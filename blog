🔍 What Drives Inflation?

Exploring insights from 50 years of global economic data

Inflation affects everything — from your grocery bill to national budgets. But what drives it? Can we actually predict inflation based on historical economic signals like foreign investment, GDP per capita, and unemployment?

To explore these questions, we analyzed data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, covering nearly five decades of economic data. The goal: understand the forces behind inflation and test whether machine learning could make useful predictions.

❓ Questions We Asked

What are the most important economic indicators that influence inflation?

Can a machine learning model accurately predict inflation using these indicators?

What happens in a hypothetical future scenario — can we forecast inflation reliably?

💡 What We Found
🔗 1. Some indicators move together — others don’t

Our data showed strong relationships between certain indicators:

GDP per capita and Imports moved closely together.

Unemployment and Inflation showed a moderate relationship — suggesting rising unemployment may correlate with inflation pressures in some economies.

📊 Top correlated features with inflation:

Economic Indicator	Correlation with Inflation
Tax Revenue (% of GDP)	+0.61
Unemployment Rate (%)	+0.45
Foreign Direct Investment (% of GDP)	+0.32
GDP per Capita (US$)	-0.25

💬 Tax revenue had the strongest positive link to inflation — possibly because growing tax burdens may indicate expanding government size, or reactionary policies to inflation itself.

🧠 2. Machine Learning Can Predict Inflation Accurately

We trained a machine learning model using past economic data. It correctly captured inflation trends with over 90% accuracy (R² score of ~0.93).

This means we can use patterns in GDP, unemployment, FDI, and more to make useful predictions — especially for forecasting, planning, and simulation.

🔮 3. What If... We Test a Hypothetical Economy?

We asked the model to predict inflation for a fictional economy with the following profile:

Indicator	Value
FDI (% of GDP)	25%
GDP per capita	$40,000
Imports of goods and services	$25 billion
Tax revenue (% of GDP)	22%
Unemployment	5%

📌 Predicted Inflation: 4.83% (Example — replace with your actual model output)

This scenario demonstrates how governments, economists, or even businesses can forecast inflationary trends based on economic conditions — helping make proactive decisions.

🌍 Why This Matters

Understanding inflation isn't just for economists. It affects:

🛒 What we can afford

📉 Investment decisions

🏛️ Government spending

🧮 Business planning

By combining global economic data with AI tools, we can get a clearer picture of the future — and respond before it hits our wallets.

✨ Final Thoughts

Inflation is complex — but with the right data and tools, it becomes more predictable than it seems. Whether you're a policymaker, data enthusiast, or just financially curious, understanding these signals can help you stay one step ahead.
